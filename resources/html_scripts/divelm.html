    <h1>My use of language and my cats</h1>
    
    <p>My cat's behavior hasn't changed much since her absence, except
    that she plays her new physique to the neighbors regularly, in an
    attempt to get pets.</p>
    
    <div lang="en-GB">
        <p>My other cat, coloured black and white, is a sweetie. He followed
        us to the pool today, walking down the pavement with us. Yesterday
        he apparently visited our neighbours. I wonder if he recognises that
        their flat is a mirror image of ours.</p>
        
        <p>Hm, I just noticed that in the last paragraph I used British
        English. But I'm supposed to write in American English. So I
        shouldn't say "pavement" or "flat" or "colour"...</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>I should say "sidewalk" and "apartment" and "color"!</p>
